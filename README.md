This game consists of a Player and Enemies. The goal of the game is for the player to reach the "water" without touching any of the enemies (or bugs). The player can reach the water by using the directional arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT). An additional enemy is added to the game for every victory by the player, the player is also reset whenever they win a round by making it to the water. Enemies are added at random speeds and positions. If the enemy makes contact with the Player the Player and enemies are reset.
